A Little Unix-like

Just a little personal project of mine. Writing a small Unix-like system from
scratch targetting x86-64 EFI machines. Looking to learn everything I can along
the way and hopefully create a cool little system.

Currently I have a UEFI bootloader that loads an ELF kernel and a console font
for it's system console. Very simple bootloader. Will be revisited and improved
at a later date where necessary.

I have just started the kernel. Has a super barebones system console interface
setup that will suffice for early development of the system.

TODO
----

 - Bootloader
 	- Check code cleanliness
	- Improve error handling, explore error recovery
 - Kernel
 	- everything

`spleen` font for the console is licensed differently, see:
